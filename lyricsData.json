It's enough\nAll the gibberish on my ear Imma let it blow\nMy five senses are focused on it, on edge\nYou come in and stir it up recklessly\nWhen I fall asleep with one eye open\nYou permeate without a sound, the phantom\nI'm so sick and tired of it\nWhen the light turns on, I hope you're gone\n\nYou say it's for me?
